  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA512

We have added our PGP keys and our email to the website. There are checkers available that, when combined with our key and a message such as this, will see if its genuine. Only we can sign on these, so do not trust statements that are not signed! 

There is now also an email, imphalicu@proton.me. There will be reasonable security on it if you wish to send us documents or anything else, but you can optionally use the aforementioned PGP keys. If you're confused as to what a PGP is, it allows people to verify if something was really written by the person it says is the author.

There will be updates like these every so often, on our webpage imphal-icu.github.io
