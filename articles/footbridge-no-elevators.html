  <h1>Pedestrian footbridges waste away with unfinished elevators</h1>
  <p>27 DECEMBER 2025: In Imphal's pedestrian bridges, elevators were due to be added, with work progressing quickly. Then, it stalled. The elevator project remains incomplete to this day.</p>
  <p>Inside, all equipment was put in place except the lift itself. After many years of the probably substandard boards withstanding the elements, they started breaking.</p>
  <p>Huge interior damage could be seen inside the structures, after consistent rain exposure. The lack of elevators is proving to be a large inconvenience to the elderly and those with disabilities.</p>
  <p>People are now using the areas near elevator doors as a dumping ground, and some of it has gotten into the shaft too.</p>
