    <h1>Manipur Education: In a disastrous state</h1>
    <p>Across Manipur's extremely high number of dilapidated schools, there are a bunch of schools with barely any teachers. One such school is Karang High School, UDISE code 14040201301. According to official UDISE data, there are 75 students, class 1 to 10. For the 75 students, there are only 2 teachers. </p>
    <p>The school also lacks toilet facility. It has not been upgraded in years and is lacking opportunities to students. The school's "playground" consists of a single swing, and the rest of the playground equipment was found inside a school building that was never finished.</p>
    <p>There were plans to develop a new building for the school, but all that's left is a single concrete room and a few "classrooms" whose roofs are collapsing. There should be atleast 15 teachers for a high school. Electricity supply exists but is not functional. </p>
    <p>There has been very little investment from the government to the school. When funds have been allocated for development, it is usually stolen.</p>
    <p>Due to dismal student-teacher ratio, proper education will be very stunted. Opportunities for students will also be very narrow. Classes are irregular and parents who can afford it usually send their children to boarding schools in Imphal.</p>
    <p>Another example is Canchipur High School, which boasted a.. 0% pass rate in the 2025 matric exam. In the school, of 9 rooms available, only 2 are in good condition. The remaining 7 rooms are dilapidated and need extensive repairs. </p>
    <p>Here is a list of all government schools with a 0% pass rate, sorted by number of students:</p>
    <ul>
<li>- Tamenglong Hr. Sec. School - 26 students</li>
<li>- Senapati Govt. High School - 10 students</li>
<li>- Paomata High School - 9 students</li>
<li>- Shyamasakhi High School - 8 students</li>
<li>- Oinam High School - 5 students</li>
<li>- Minuthong Faizia High Madrassa - 5 students</li>
<li>- Maram High School - 5 students</li>
<li>- Songtal High School - 4 students</li>
<li>- Paobitek High School - 4 students</li>
<li>- Haobam Marak High School - 4 students</li>
<li>- Canchipur High School - 4 students</li>
<li>- Seikhor High School - 3 students</li>
<li>- Thamchet High School - 2 students</li>
<li>- Shingkap High School - 2 students</li>
<li>- Oklong High School - 1 student</li>
<li>- Namtiram High School - 1 student</li>
<li>- Leirenjao High School - 1 student</li>
<li>- Gallam High School - 1 student</li>
</ul>
<p>So, there are 18 schools where no student passed Class 10 in 2025. Very telling of the situation the system is in.</p>
