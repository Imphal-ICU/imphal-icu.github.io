<h1>The collapse of the Imphal Smart City mission</h1>
<p><i>The collapse of a once promising project</i></p>
<h2>The "smart GPS bicycles": rusting away</h2>
<p>After a <a href="https://e-pao.net/GP.asp?src=29..270522.may22">huge</a> launch in 2022, the smart bicycles across Imphal are rusting away. The problem is not awareness: its just that the project was not maintained afterwards. Also, many people, especially elderly, found the service very hard to use.</p>
<p>This policy of "launch and let it rot" cannot continue. Every few years, the government launches something then it is forgotten, then it breaks. Then a new project is started. The 2023 conflict did distrub implementation, but it just showed the extreme brittleness of the project.</p>
<p>And now, all that's left are half-completed projects, wasted taxpayer money and dashed hopes.</p>
<h2>Where did the waste disposal smart tags go?</h2>
<p>Just a few years back, the Imphal Smart City mission installed smart tags to track garbage collection. But where are they now? It seems they got silently removed sometime in 2023-24. </p>
<p>There are very few mentions online of this scheme, nevermind its removal, so some parts might be missing.</p>
<h2>Brand new road torn up</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.thesangaiexpress.com/Encyc/2025/12/5/by-our-staff-reporter-imphal-dec-4-as-a-part-of-developing-imphal-as-a-smart-city-a-road-blocker-bollard-syste.html">pedestrian-friendly pavement at Thangal Bazar</a> has been torn up, to make way for the paving of new concrete road. 550 crores have been allocated to the mission as a whole, of which <a href="https://indiainvestmentgrid.gov.in/opportunities/project/600549">5.6 crores</a> has been allocated to the Mall Road project. How much of it has been wasted? </p>
<p>Less than 100 crores of the concrete road laying project has been spent, according to the Sangai Express. Concrete roads of the same length generally cost Rs. 15-25 lakh, which could have easily been avoided. </p>
<p>The amount of money wasted is around the range of 5.7 crores.</p>
<p>The mission began in 2016, with 24 projects allocated. Now, only 17 are complete, far missing deadlines. Weak governance and negligence is the root cause of these problems.</p>
