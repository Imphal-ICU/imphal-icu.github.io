  <h1>Yet another money waste: New rotary parking garage at Nagamapal</h1>
  <p>26 December 2025: A new rotary parking garage is being built in Nagamapal. It cost around Rs. 2 crores to construct and will be open by January 2026, according to e-Pao news. It can only fit 42 cars. Is this investment justified? 42 cars off the road will have essentially no effect on the traffic situation. </p>
  <p>The diversions put in place during construction have probably offset nearly all potential traffic savings it can have. Many on the internet are already asking about the safety of the project. Why can the government build a glorified ferris wheel for cars but not fix the potholes right nearby?</p>
  <p>Let us wait and see if this is any good for the 1 year it will last before it gets abandoned.</p>
