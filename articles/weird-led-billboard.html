  <h1>That weird LED billboard they put up in Kangla: Half Broken</h1>
  <p>During June 2019, the former CM of Manipur, N. Biren came to Kangla and inaugarated an LED billboard right next to Kangla Gate. It is operated by a certain Leibak Information Technology Pvt Ltd.</p>
  <p>After some time being used as an obnoxious TV screen, in the midst of the 2023 violence, it shut off for a few months. The bottom screen used to display air quality information, which has now ceased.</p>
  <p>The top screen also ran an advertisement campaign for ROM Cab, until it was replaced by a slideshow of important people including the PM and the Governor.</p>
  <p>What kind of idea is it to put an advertising board right next to the most important tourism site? All it does is ruin photos for tourists, though we're sure the contractors and politicians loved the extra money.</p>
  <p>Quite recently, black bars and other visual artifacts have started appearing, which have still not been fixed.</p>
  <br>
  <p>LED billboards cost anywhere from 8 to 20 lakh rupees, though considering its less-than-great quality, we can assume the cost to be around 8-12 lakhs, all of which is completely unnecessary and essentially wasted, in addition to spoiling countless views of the Kangla Gate.</p>
