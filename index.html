<h1>Brand new road torn up</h1>
<p>The pedestrian-friendly pavement at Thangal Bazar has been torn up, to make way for the paving of new concrete road. 550 crores have been allocated to the mission as a whole. How much of it has been wasted? </p>
<p>Less than 100 crores of the concrete road laying project has been spent, according to the Sangai Express. Concrete roads generally cost 1-5 crores per km, so the losses are going to be in this range.</p>
